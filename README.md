This project presents a comprehensive dashboard visualizing various healthcare metrics. The dashboard tracks patient admissions, billing amounts by insurance providers and age groups, patient distribution by medical condition, test results, and monthly admissions, helping healthcare administrators to make informed decisions.

## Data Sources

HealthCare Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "healthcare_data.csv". It includes detailed records on patient admissions, medical conditions, insurance billing, and other related metrics.

## Tools

- Excel - Data Cleaning, Data Analysis and Creating Dashboard.

This dashboard was developed using Microsoft Excel. You can download it from the [Microsoft Office Website](https://www.office.com/).

## Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Spell checking
3. Correcting misspelt values.
4. Removal of empty rows.
5. Removal of duplicated values.
6. Handling missing values.
7. Data cleaning and formatting.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the healthcare data to answer key questions, such as:
- What are the total number of patients treated?
- What is the average length of patient stays?
- What is the total billing amount accumulated?
- What are the different types of patient admissions in the top_5 hospitals?
- How does the average billing amount vary by insurance provider?
- What is the distribution of patients by medical condition?
- What is the average billing amount by age group?
- How do test results distribute among patients?
- What is the trend in monthly admissions over time?

## Results/Findings

Key findings from the analysis include:
- Emergency admissions are the most frequent across several hospitals, highlighting a significant need for emergency care resources.
- Billing amounts show minimal variance among different insurance providers, indicating standardized pricing across hospital services.
- Patients are evenly distributed across major conditions such as Arthritis, Asthma, Cancer, and more, suggesting a diverse medical needs base.
- Pediatric care results in slightly higher billing amounts, possibly due to more intensive treatments required for children.
- Admissions peak in March and October, possibly due to seasonal health trends.
- The total billing amount reflects the extensive volume of healthcare services provided.
- Most test results are normal, but a third are abnormal or inconclusive, indicating possible areas for improvement in diagnostic processes.

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:
- Increase staff during peak admission months (March and October) to handle patient inflow efficiently.
- Implement and train staff on standardized emergency care protocols to enhance response efficiency and patient outcomes.
- Conduct billing audits to identify and correct discrepancies and ensure fair billing practices across age groups and insurance providers.
- Launch health initiatives focusing on prevention and management for prevalent conditions like Diabetes and Hypertension.
- Upgrade diagnostic tools and train technicians to reduce the rate of abnormal and inconclusive test results.
- Enhance patient management through integrated digital health platforms for better data handling and patient engagement.
